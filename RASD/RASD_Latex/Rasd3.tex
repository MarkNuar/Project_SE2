		\section{Functional requirements}
			\subsection{Scenarios}
				\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
					\paragraph{}
						Cat has a disabled child. Tired from everybody that leaves their car in the disable's parking lot, Cat decides to download and install the SafeStreets app. After subscribing to the service, she starts to take pictures of all the perpetrator's cars. Some time after, Cat notices that her reports are getting validated and along with that the number of times that she founds cars in the disabled parking lot starts to diminish, that may be because the local police intervened and ticketed them.
				\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
					\paragraph{}
						Ned is looking for a house in the city, he has always lived in the countryside and he's scared of the possibility to live in areas with difficulty in finding car parks. He opens SafeStreets and using ''Get unsafe areas'' and, by selecting areas around his favourite house on sale, he can find what happened there and he can avoid the worst areas, looking for a house with confidence.
				\subsubsection{Scenario 3}
					\paragraph{}
						Jon has a reputation for not being a trustworthy guy. When he decides to use SafeStreets, Jon starts to report every car that he does not like, hoping that the owners of those car will receive a ticket. Luckily for the owners, those report won't incur in any fine because the local police is able to validate the received reports and does not issue the cars in order, ignoring Jon's report.
				\subsubsection{Scenario 4}
					\paragraph{}
						Martha works as a municipal employee. The mayor asks her to make a list of all possible investment to develop the streets of the city, in order to increase street security. Luckily for Martha, SafeStreets with its function ''Get Improvements'', highlights the most unsafe areas and suggests possible interventions. Reading these recommendations, Martha realizes that some of them have already been done so she diligently set them as completed. Martha can now finish her assignment quickly.
				\subsubsection{Scenario 5}
					\paragraph{}
						The mayor, to promote his image before the next elections, wants to publish a report with the statistics regarding public security. With SafeStreets his secretary can easily retrieve such information and prepare a detailed report with all the statistics about how public street security has improved during the mayor's mandate.
				\subsubsection{Scenario 6}
					\paragraph{}
						A group of citizens is concerned with the street security of their neighborhood but they don't have any real data that can be used to support their concerns. They go to the municipality to ask for more information and possibly an intervention of the authorities. The municipality can quickly search for data regarding their area and forward it to higher authorities that will hopefully do something.
				\subsubsection{Scenario 7}
					\paragraph{}
						A local officer in patrol is tasked to give fines during his work shift but usually, this isn't such an easy task. Normally he would spend a lot of time searching the usual street but, using SafeStreets, he can now retrieve reports about positions of parking violations using ''Mine Reports'' function. With this information, the local officer starts the search. Luckily for him, he finds a lot of violations in the streets specified by SafeStreet, so he can proceed and charge the owners of those cars for their sins (violations).

		\section{Performance requirements}
			\paragraph{}
				The system does not have any particular performance requirements. Obviously, it will have to be able to handle multiple operations from multiple clients (users and authorities) at the same time.
		\section{Design constraints}
			\subsection{Standard compliance}
				\paragraph{}
					The system adopts the current traffic rules in order to provide all the possible VTs.
			\subsection{Hardware limitations}
				\paragraph{}
					The system presents hardware requirements only on the user's side. As a matter of fact, the user is required to have a smartphone with a camera and internet connection (wifi or mobile). Authorities need at least a device capable of connecting to the net.
		\section{Software systems attributes}
			\subsection{Reliability}
				\paragraph{}
					In order to provide reliability, the system must be resilient to faults. The solution is to replicate the system's server. In particular, it will be fault-tolerant against Byzantine faults (faults where a disconnected system has unforeseeable
behaviors) , so the number of replicas of the system's server must be, at least, \textit{(3*number of failing replicas)+1}, with the number of failing replicas decided during the design and implementation.
			\subsection{Availability}
				\paragraph{}
					In order to provide availability, as mentioned in the reliability section, the system's server must be replicated. In this way, it is possible to obtain a 24/7 service. Obviously, little deviations from these requirements will be accepted.
			\subsection{Security}
				\paragraph{}
					In order to provide security, both end users and authorities' data will be always transferred trough encrypted channels. The encryption will be achieved through the usage of public and private keys, each message will be encoded first with the private key of the sender, secondly the public key of the receiver will be used. Moreover every report, sent by the user, is provided with a digital signature, which will make the server able to realize if unauthorized data manipulation has been performed during the data transfer. Thanks to these techniques the purpose of maintaining the chain of custody from the user up to the authorities will be fulfilled.
			\subsection{Maintainability}
				\paragraph{}
					In order to provide maintainability, the development of the system has to be done so that will be easy and cheap to fix and modify it in the future. In order to achieve these properties, appropriate design patterns will be used. More of this in the design document.
			\subsection{Portability}
				\paragraph{}
					In order to provide portability, the system will be available as a downloadable app for the user and as a web service for the authorities.
