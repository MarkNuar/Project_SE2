Cat has a disabled child. Tired from everybody that leave their car in the disable’s parking lot, Cat decides to download and install SafeStreets™ app. After subscribing to the service, she starts to take pictures of all the perpetrator’s cars. Sometime after, Cat notices that her reports are getting validated and along with that the number of times that she founds cars in the disabled parking lot start to diminish, that may be because the local police intervened and ticketed them.
