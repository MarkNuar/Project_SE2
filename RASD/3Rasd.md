## 3.2. Functional Requirements 
### 3.2.1. Scenarios
#### 3.2.1.1 Scenario 1
Cat has a disabled child. Tired from everybody that leave their car in the disable’s parking lot, Cat decides to download and install SafeStreets™ app. After subscribing to the service, she starts to take pictures of all the perpetrator’s cars. Sometime after, Cat notices that her reports are getting validated and along with that the number of times that she founds cars in the disabled parking lot start to diminish, that may be because the local police intervened and ticketed them.

Ned is looking for a house in the city, he has always lived in the countryside and  he’s scared of the possibility to live in areas with difficulty in finding car parks. He opens SafeStreets™ and using “Get Reports By Area” he can find the worst areas in the city and he can avoid them, looking for a house with confidence.
